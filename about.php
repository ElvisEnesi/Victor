            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our online campus restaurant was created to make food ordering easier and stress-free for students. Instead of waiting in long queues, 
                students can now browse the menu, place orders, and pick up meals conveniently. 
                This system was inspired by the need to save time, reduce congestion, and improve the overall campus dining experience.
